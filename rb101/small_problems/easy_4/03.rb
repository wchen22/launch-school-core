# In the modern era under the Gregorian Calendar, leap years occur in every year that is evenly divisible by 4, unless the year is also divisible by 100. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year unless the year is evenly divisible by 400.

# Assume this rule is good for any year greater than year 0. Write a method that takes any year greater than 0 as input, and returns true if the year is a leap year, or false if it is not a leap year.

def leap_year?(year)
  if year % 400 == 0
    true
  elsif year % 100 == 0
    false
  elsif year % 4 == 0
    true
  else false
  end
end

# p leap_year?(2016) == true
# p leap_year?(2015) == false
# p leap_year?(2100) == false
# p leap_year?(2400) == true
# p leap_year?(240000) == true
# p leap_year?(240001) == false
# p leap_year?(2000) == true
# p leap_year?(1900) == false
# p leap_year?(1752) == true
# p leap_year?(1700) == false
# p leap_year?(1) == false
# p leap_year?(100) == false
# p leap_year?(400) == true

# Further exploration: the order in which you perform tests for a leap year calculation is important. For what years will leap_year? fail if you rewrite it as:

def leap_year?(year)
  if year % 100 == 0
    false
  elsif year % 400 == 0
    true
  else
    year % 4 == 0
  end
end

# When we check for 100 first, then we also lump in all years divisible by 400, which would erroneously return false.

# Can you rewrite leap_year? to perform its tests in the opposite order of the above solution? That is, test whether the year is divisible by 4 first, then, if necessary, test whether it is divisible by 100, and finally, if necessary, test whether it is divisible by 400. Is this solution simpler or more complex than the original solution?

# No, not by just swapping the clauses - if we set the first clause to return true if the year is divisible by 4, it will exit out and return true for all years divisible by 100 which is not what we want. 

# We would have to test to see if the year is divisible by 4, then nest an additional if statement to check if it's divisible by 100, then also check to see if it's divisble by 400. Probably best to avoid the nested if statements if possible.

def leap_year?(year)
  if year % 4 == 0
    if year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0
      return false
    else 
      return true
    end
  end
  false
