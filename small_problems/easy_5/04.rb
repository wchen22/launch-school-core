# Given a string of words separated by spaces, write a method that takes this string of words and returns a string in which the first and last letters of every word are swapped.

# You may assume that every word contains at least one letter, and that the string will always contain at least one word. You may also assume that each string contains nothing but words and spaces/

def swap(sentence)
  sentence.split.map do |word| 
    word.size > 1 ? word[-1] + word[1..-2] + word[0] : word
  end.join(' ')
end
 
# LS solution 

def swap_first_last_characters(word)
  word[0], word[-1] = word[-1], word[0]
  word
end

def swap(words)
  result = words.split.map do |word|
    swap_first_last_characters(word)
  end
  result.join(' ')
end
# Examples:

p swap('Oh what a wonderful day it is')== 'hO thaw a londerfuw yad ti si'
p swap('Abcde') == 'ebcdA'
p swap('a') == 'a'
