# A triangle is classified as follows:

# right One angle of the triangle is a right angle (90 degrees)
# acute All 3 angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees
# obtuse One angle is greater than 90 degrees.
# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the angles must be exactly 180 degrees, and all angles must be greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the 3 angles of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :right, :acute, :obtuse, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is a right, acute, obtuse, or invalid triangle.

# You may assume integer valued angles so you don't have to worry about floating point errors. You may also assume that the arguments are specified in degrees.

def triangle(a1, a2, a3)
  angles = [a1, a2, a3]
  case
  when angles.any? { |angle| angle <= 0} , angles.sum != 180
    :invalid
  when angles.max == 90
    :right
  when angles.max > 90
    :obtuse
  else :acute
  end
end

# Examples:

p triangle(60, 70, 50) == :acute
p triangle(30, 90, 60) == :right
p triangle(120, 50, 10) == :obtuse
p triangle(0, 90, 90) == :invalid
p triangle(50, 50, 50) == :invalid
