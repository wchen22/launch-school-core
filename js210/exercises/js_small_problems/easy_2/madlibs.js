// Madlibs
// Madlibs is a simple game where you create a story template with "blanks" for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

// Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective, and injects them into a story that you create.

// Example:

// Enter a noun: dog
// Enter a verb: walk
// Enter an adjective: blue
// Enter an adverb: quickly

// // console output
// Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!

const rlSync = require('readline-sync');

  const noun = rlSync.question('Enter a noun: ');
  const verb = rlSync.question('Enter a verb: ');
  const adjective = rlSync.question('Enter an adjective: ');
  const adverb = rlSync.question('Enter an adverb: ');
  
  console.log(`Do you ${verb} your ${adjective} ${noun} ${adverb}? That's hilarious!`)
}
