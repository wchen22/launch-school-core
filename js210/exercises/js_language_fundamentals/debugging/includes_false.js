// Includes False
// Caroline has written a very simple function, includesFalse, that searches a list of primitives for the boolean false. If false is found, the function immediately returns true. If no occurrence of false has been found after iterating through the entire array, the function returns false.

// Caroline's last method invocation of includesFalse (line 15) doesn't return what she expects. Why is that? Fix the code so that it behaves as intended.

function includesFalse(list) {
  for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    let element = list[i];

    if (element == false) { // change to strict equality
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}

// returns:console.log(
console.log(includesFalse([8, null, 'abc', true, 'launch', 11, false]));       // true
console.log(includesFalse(['programming', undefined, 37, 64, true, 'false'])); // false
console.log(includesFalse([9422, 'lambda', true, '54', null]));             // true; == coerces `false` to 0 so inadvertently traverses that clause.
