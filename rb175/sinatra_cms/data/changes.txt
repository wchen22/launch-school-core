We want to create an albums table to hold all the above data except the singer name, and create a reference from the albums table to the singers table to link each album to the correct singer. Write the necessary SQL statements to do this and to populate the table with data. Assume Album Name, Genre, and Label can hold strings up to 100 characters. Include an auto-incrementing id column in the albums table.
