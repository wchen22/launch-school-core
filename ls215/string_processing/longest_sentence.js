// Code Review: Longest Sentence
// Write a program that determines the sentence with the most words in some text. Sentences may end with periods (.), exclamation points (!), or question marks (?). Sentences begin with a word character and end with any of the following characters: ., !, or ?. Note that the sentence-ending characters are part of the sentence. Word characters may be any character other than , ., !, or ?. Within each sentence, words are delimited by one or more spaces. Log the longest sentence and its word count to the console. Pay attention to the expected output. Note that this problem is about manipulating and processing strings. As such, every detail about the string matters (e.g., case, punctuation, tabs, spaces, etc.).

// Post your solution as a Code Review in this lesson's forum.
