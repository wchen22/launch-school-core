# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

# 

unicornfish.move
penguin.move
robin.move


# Further exploration: Is the FlightlessBird#initialize method necessary? Why or why not?

# It's not necessary in this program because the constructor doesn't do anything aside from calling the Animal superclass constructor.
